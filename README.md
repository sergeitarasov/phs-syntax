# phs-syntax package for Atom

PhenoScript syntax highlight for [Atom](https://atom.io) editor. Based on [r-syntax](https://atom.io/packages/r-syntax) package (and may require having it installed since current version of the package is experimental).

To install dowload the package and run in terminal `apm link <path_to_phs_syntax_folder>`. Also install `r-syntax` and `snippet-injector` by selecting from within Atom `Atom->Prefrences->Packages`.

From [apm repo](https://github.com/atom/apm): apm is bundled and installed automatically with Atom. You can run the Atom > Install Shell Commands menu option to install it again if you aren't able to run it from a terminal (macOS only).

To make the highlight working, go to Atom, open any PhenoScrit file, hold down ´cntr + shift+L´ or click `Edit` -> `Select Grammar` and select 'PhenoScript'.
